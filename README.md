#This is a xlxs raport generator I made for my work. Main task of this program is to read xlsx file with yearly sales from enitire store. Then for each brand|producer program generates a new file which contains articles that we will return since they had no sales. There is a simple formula written that calculates that.

Right now if producer label have slashes('/') program is crashing. Dunno how to fix that since I'm using f-string to generate files names. Maybe format function ?
